# [2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-three-consecutive-integers-that-sum-to-a-given-number/)

## Problem Statement:

```
Given an integer num, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that sum to num. 
If num cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: num = 33
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].

Example 2:

Input: num = 4
Output: []
Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.
```

## Constraints:

```
* 0 <= num <= 1e15
```
