# [2193. Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-make-palindrome/)

## Problem Statement:

```
You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase English letters.

In one move, you can select any two adjacent characters of s and swap them.

Return the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome.

Note that the input will be generated such that s can always be converted to a palindrome.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "aabb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can obtain two palindromes from s, "abba" and "baab". 
- We can obtain "abba" from s in 2 moves: "aabb" -> "abab" -> "abba".
- We can obtain "baab" from s in 2 moves: "aabb" -> "abab" -> "baab".
Thus, the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome is 2.

Example 2:

Input: s = "letelt"
Output: 2
Explanation:
One of the palindromes we can obtain from s in 2 moves is "lettel".
One of the ways we can obtain it is "letelt" -> "letetl" -> "lettel".
Other palindromes such as "tleelt" can also be obtained in 2 moves.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a palindrome in less than 2 moves.
```

## Constraints:

```
* 1 <= s.length <= 2000
* s consists only of lowercase English letters.
* s can be converted to a palindrome using a finite number of moves.
```

  ```cpp

// Greedily let the characters from the left be on their places and find its pair
// If we get the pair, then shift it to exact same spot from the right
// i.e. if left is on i and then right should be on n-1-i;

// If we dont get its pair then note its index, at last we have to shift it to middle
