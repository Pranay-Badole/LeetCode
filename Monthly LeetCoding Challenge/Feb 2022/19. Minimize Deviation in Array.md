# [1675. Minimize Deviation in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-deviation-in-array/)

## Problem Statement:

```
You are given an array nums of n positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

* If the element is even, divide it by 2.
     For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].
* If the element is odd, multiply it by 2.
     For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].
The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,10,8]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints:

```
Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 2 <= n <= 1e5
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 1e9
```

  ```cpp

It boils down to :
We are given n vectors we have to choose n elements "one from each vector"
 such that min and max elements have the least difference possible.

     12 18 10 2
     2 8 19 1
     5 8 9 10

so first we will sort the vectors

idx : 0   2 10 12 18
idx : 1   1 2 8 19
idx : 2   5 8 9 10

now we choose first element from each vector (total n) ==> (2, 1, 5) 
mn = 1 mx = 5; dif = 4 

now we choose the min of these n elements and add the next element of that vector if exists if not end the algo. 

here mn = 1 and idx = 1 
so we will add 2  (1 -> 2, 8, 9)

(2, 1, 5) ==> (2, 2, 5)

we carry on unless we reach the end of any vector
