# [847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes/)

## Problem Statement:

```
You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]

Example 2:

Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
```

## Constraints:

```
* n == graph.length
* 1 <= n <= 12
* 0 <= graph[i].length < n
* graph[i] does not contain i.
* If graph[a] contains b, then graph[b] contains a.
* The input graph is always connected.
```

// This is simple BFS but it was important to figure out that we dont have to just
// only store visited vertices but also the vertices that are visited before visiting current vertex
// i.e stored using mask

// therfore: 
// 2-D visited vector of vertices and mask
