# [1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

## Problem Statement:

```
You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, 
causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. 
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.

Example 2:

Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"

Example 3:

Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```

## Constraints:

```
* 1 <= s.length <= 1e5
* 2 <= k <= 1e4
* s only contains lower case English letters.
```

  ```cpp

// STACK

// As the cnt of consecutive chars gets equal to k
// We have to delete all those chars

// As we have to keep note of prev characters and also delete them when needed
// Stack is the most appropriate and suitabel Data Structure for this.

// Also when we insert 2 consecutive chars
// instead of pushing chars twice like

// {ch, 1} {ch, 2};

// Just modify the top of stack from {ch, 1} to {ch, 2}

// #spaceOptimization

// Also while deleting we don't need to pop all k top elements
// just pop the first element

class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string s, int k) {
        stack<pair<char, int>> st;
        int n = s.size();

                int cnt = st.top().second;
