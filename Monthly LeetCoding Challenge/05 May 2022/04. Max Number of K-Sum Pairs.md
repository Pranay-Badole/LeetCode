# [1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-number-of-k-sum-pairs/)

## Problem Statement:

```
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
```

## Constraints:

```
* 1 <= nums.length <= 1e5
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 1e9
* 1 <= k <= 1e9
```

  ```cpp

// 2 Pointers

// Sort the array
// then use the two sum method
// when we get the sum as 'k' and increase the ans += 1;
// increment and decrement the pointers respectively


class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        
        int l = 0, r = n-1;
        int ans = 0;
        
        while(l < r) {
            if(nums[l] + nums[r] < k) {
                l++;
            }
            else if(nums[l] + nums[r] > k) {
                r--;
            }
            else {
                ans++;
                l++;
                r--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
