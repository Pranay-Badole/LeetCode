# [1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sorted-vowel-strings/)

## Problem Statement:

```
Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist 
only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.

A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, 
s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are
["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].
Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet.

Example 3:

Input: n = 33
Output: 66045
```

## Constraints:

```
* 1 <= n <= 50
```

  ```cpp

// Dynamic Programming

// dp[pos][vowel]
// denotes we can fill the position 'pos' with vowels starting from 'vowel' to 5(e)

// so suppose after filling position 'pos' with lets say with some vowel 'z'
// the next call will be dp[pos+1][z];

// and keep going till "pos <= n";

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> dp;
    
    int fun(int pos, int vowel, int &n) {
        if(pos > n) return 1;
        
        if(dp[pos][vowel] != -1) {
            return dp[pos][vowel];
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for(int z = vowel; z <= 5; z++) {
            ans += fun(pos+1, z, n);
        }
        return dp[pos][vowel] = ans;
    }
    
    int countVowelStrings(int n) {
        dp.assign(n+1, vector<int>(6, -1));
        int ans = fun(1, 1, n);
        return ans;
    }
