# [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

## Problem Statement:

```
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints:

```
* 1 <= n <= 1e5
* nums.length == n + 1
* 1 <= nums[i] <= n
* All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
```

  ```cpp

// Used floyd's cycle many times in linkedlist
// But never in array as here.
// So was a little bit confused
// slow & fast pointer - points to the value of current index not the index

// treat slow and fast as the nodes of linkedlist
// so start with slow = nums[0] and fast = nums[0] not with 0;

// while(slow != fast) {-----}

// then we have to keep assign any one pointer to the start 
// i.e slow = nums[0];

// while(slow != fast) {------}

class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int slow = nums[0], fast = nums[0];
        
        slow = nums[slow];
        fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        
        while(slow != fast) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }
        slow = nums[0];
        while(slow != fast) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
};
