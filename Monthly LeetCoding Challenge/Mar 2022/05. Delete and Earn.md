# [740. Delete and Earn](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/)

## Problem Statement:

```
You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```

## Constraints:

```
* 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 1e4
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 1e4
```

        dp[1] = mp[1];
        
        for(int i = 2; i <= mx; i++) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + (i * mp[i]), dp[i-1]); 
        }
        return dp[mx];
    }
