# [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

## Problem Statement:

```
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

## Constraints:

```
* 0 <= s.length <= 100
* 0 <= t.length <= 1e4
* s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
```
