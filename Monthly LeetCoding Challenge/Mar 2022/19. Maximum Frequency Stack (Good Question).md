# [895. Maximum Frequency Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack/)

## Problem Statement:

```
Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

Implement the FreqStack class:

FreqStack() constructs an empty frequency stack.
void push(int val) pushes an integer val onto the top of the stack.
int pop() removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input
["FreqStack", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "pop", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
[[], [5], [7], [5], [7], [4], [5], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 5, 7, 5, 4]

Explanation
FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 4, as 4, 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7].
```

## Constraints:

```
* 0 <= val <= 1e9
* At most 2 * 1e4 calls will be made to push and pop.
* It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack before calling pop.
```

  <summary> CODE </summary>
  
  ```cpp


// Good Question 

* 1st approach is to use heap
     // heap of pair<int, pair<int, int>>
    //  priority_queue<pair<frequency, pair<time, value>>>;

     // frequency if the current frequency of the element
     // time is the time when it was inserted like(0, 1, 2, 3....) this is imp in case of tie
     // value - the number which is begin pushed

* 2nd is to use map of stacks
     // frequency map which contains the freq of all elements at any instance

     // mp[x] = contains all the element with frequency 'x' in time order, the element at top is the most recent one

     // 'mx' variable contains the maximum frequency of any element till now (imp use while popping element)


class FreqStack {
public:
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    unordered_map<int, stack<int>> mp;
    int mx = -1;
    
    FreqStack() {
    }
    
    void push(int val) {
        int cur = freq[val];
        freq[val]++;
        
        mp[cur].push(val);
        mx = max(mx, freq[val] - 1);
    }
    
    int pop() {
        int ans = mp[mx].top();
        mp[mx].pop();
        freq[ans]--;
        if(!mp[mx].size()) mx--;
        
        return ans;
    }
};

/**
 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FreqStack* obj = new FreqStack();
 * obj->push(val);
 * int param_2 = obj->pop();
