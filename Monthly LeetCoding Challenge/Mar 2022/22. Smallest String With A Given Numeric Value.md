# [1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-a-given-numeric-value/)

## Problem Statement:

```
The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet, 
so the numeric value of a is 1, the numeric value of b is 2, the numeric value of c is 3, and so on.

The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. 
For example, the numeric value of the string "abe" is equal to 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

You are given two integers n and k. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to n and numeric value equal to k.

Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, 
either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 27
Output: "aay"
Explanation: The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, k = 73
Output: "aaszz"
```

## Constraints:

```
* 1 <= n <= 1e5
* n <= k <= 26 * n
```

  ```cpp

// Greedy
// The string will be of length 'n'
// So form a string with all chars as 'a'
// now k ==> k - n;
// Now start from the end and greedily take as max char as possible till k > 0;

class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        string ans(n, 'a');
        int rem = k - n;
        
        int r = n-1;
        
        while(rem) {
            if(rem <= 25) {
                ans[r] += rem;
                rem = 0;
            }
            else{
                ans[r] = 'z';
                rem -= 25;
            }
            r--;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
