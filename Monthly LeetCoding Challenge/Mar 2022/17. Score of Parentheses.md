# [856. Score of Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-parentheses/)

## Problem Statement:

```
Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string.

The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:

"()" has score 1.
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: s = "(())"
Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: s = "()()"
Output: 2
```

## Constraints:

```
* 2 <= s.length <= 50
* s consists of only '(' and ')'.
* s is a balanced parentheses string.
```

  ```cpp

// 3 Approaches.

// 1) Recursion: 
// * Given a balanced string made up of several balanced substrings. 
// * Find the value of individual balanced substrings and sum it using recursion


// 2) Stack:
// * Using stack keep the track of values at every depth.
// * start stack with value '0'
// * Whenever we get '(' push 0 to stack
// * Whenever we get ')' pop the value from stack (say t1), and then add max(1, 2*t1) to the top of stack.


// 3) O(1) space: tracking the depth at every index:
// * As we know we get the value only when we get adjacent balanced pair i.e "()"
// * So we keep track of depth for each such pair and add its depth to tha answer.

    int scoreOfParentheses(string s) {

        int cur = 1;
        int ans = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(s[i] == '(' && s[i+1] != ')') cur *= 2;
            else if(s[i] == ')' && s[i-1] == '(') {
                ans += cur;
            }
            else if(s[i] == ')'){
                cur /= 2;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
