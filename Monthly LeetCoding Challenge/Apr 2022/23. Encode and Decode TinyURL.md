# [535. Encode and Decode TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/)

## Problem Statement:

```
 Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl 
and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk. 

Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.

There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work.
You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

Implement the Solution class:

* Solution() Initializes the object of the system.
* String encode(String longUrl) Returns a tiny URL for the given longUrl.
* String decode(String shortUrl) Returns the original long URL for the given shortUrl. 

It is guaranteed that the given shortUrl was encoded by the same object.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: url = "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"
Output: "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"

Explanation:
Solution obj = new Solution();
string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url.
string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after deconding it.
```

## Constraints:

```
* 1 <= url.length <= 1e4
* url is guranteed to be a valid URL.
```

    int n = s.size();
    
    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    string encode(string longUrl) {
        srand(time(0));
        string code = "";
        
        if(url_code.count(longUrl)) {
            code += url_code[longUrl];
        }
        else {
            int m = 6;
            while(m--) {
                int q = (rand()) % n;
                code += s[q];
            }
        }
        url_code[longUrl] = code;
        code_url[code] = longUrl;
        
        return "https://tinyurl.com/" + code;
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    string decode(string shortUrl) {
        string code = shortUrl.substr(20, 6);
        return code_url[code];
    }
};

// Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Solution solution;
// solution.decode(solution.encode(url));
