# [1631. Path With Minimum Effort](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/)

## Problem Statement:

```
You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). 
You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). 
You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.

Example 2:

Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].

Example 3:

Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
```

## Constraints:

```
* rows == heights.length
* columns == heights[i].length
* 1 <= rows, columns <= 100
* 1 <= heights[i][j] <= 1e6
```

  ```cpp
1)
// One way is to dijkstra's algorithm
// Where instead of using distance as the factor for priority_queue or set
// We will use the maximum difference between 2 consecutive cells in the route to reach the current cell from (0, 0), as the factor


2)
// 2nd way is to use BS and BFS
// As the problem asks us to find the minimum effort
// and whenever problem ask to find min or max try for BS

// So as we can see BS can be applied as the it is monotonic
// Now we get 'mid' check if it satisfies
// i.e. we can reach {0, 0} to {m-1, n-1} with maximu difference between not greater than mid
