# [669. Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/)

## Problem Statement:

```
Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. 
Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). 
It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
Output: [1,null,2]

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
Output: [3,2,null,1]
```

## Constraints:

```
* The number of nodes in the tree in the range [1, 1e4].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 1e4
* The value of each node in the tree is unique.
* root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
* 0 <= low <= high <= 1e4
```
