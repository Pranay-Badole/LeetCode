# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Problem Statement:

```
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn 
such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints:

```
* n == height.length
* 2 <= n <= 1e5
* 0 <= height[i] <= 1e4
```

  ```cpp

// Good question need VISUALIZATION of water filling

// Consider water level is rising eventually
// At first the width is (0 -> n-1)
// so water level will rise till mn = min(v[0], v[n-1])
// so water stored at current wicth will be = (n - 1) * mn

// After that water will start flowing down from shorter side
// So check which one is the shorter side
// and decrease the width from the same side
// i.e l++ / r--

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& v) {
        int l = 0, r = v.size() - 1;
        int ans = 0;
        
        while(l < r) {
            int temp;
            if(v[l] < v[r]) {
                temp = v[l] * (r - l);
                l++;
            }
            else {
                temp = v[r] * (r - l);
                r--;
            }
            ans = max(ans, temp);
