# [923. 3Sum With Multiplicity](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-with-multiplicity/)

## Problem Statement:

```
Given an integer array arr, and an integer target, return the number of tuples i, j, k 
such that i < j < k and arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target.

As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 1e9 + 7.
```

## Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
Output: 20
Explanation: 
Enumerating by the values (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]):
(1, 2, 5) occurs 8 times;
(1, 3, 4) occurs 8 times;
(2, 2, 4) occurs 2 times;
(2, 3, 3) occurs 2 times.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,2,2], target = 5
Output: 12
Explanation: 
arr[i] = 1, arr[j] = arr[k] = 2 occurs 12 times:
We choose one 1 from [1,1] in 2 ways,
and two 2s from [2,2,2,2] in 6 ways.
```

## Constraints:

```
* 3 <= arr.length <= 3000
* 0 <= arr[i] <= 100
* 0 <= target <= 300
```

  ```cpp

// N^2 * Log(N): doesn't pass the testcases, gives TLE

// N^2: Two loops i and j will point to the first 2 numbers
// now we need no of numbers with value (val = target - arr[i] - arr[j]);

// for this we will have two pointers l and r
// r will point to the end of the range of numnbers with value val
// l will point to the index before the start

// cnt = r - l;
// ans += cnt;
